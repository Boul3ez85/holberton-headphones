# holberton-headphones Project


# Implement a design from scratch


## An Overview:

- During this project, we will have some basic instructions so we will be free to implement the way that we want, keep the objectif simple, and follow the design of a web page.
- We will use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/70H6yS6wfBxqG6zsF7uD0V/Holberton-School---Headphone-company-(Copy)?node-id=0%3A1) in order to have access to all design details.


## Requirements:

- This project is a good exercice that simulate a web developer life in company/start-up, and experience some tools such as:
    - discussing with designers 
    - implement their work and make them review your implementation.

- We are expected to implement what we learned during last month:
    - reset CSS styling
    - use variables
    - simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
    - avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
    - simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!

- We are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
- We are not to use Javascript.


<b>Tip:</b>
Always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom.


## Objective:

- In this project, we will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. we will use all <b>HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design</b> knowledges that you learned previously.

- The objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.
